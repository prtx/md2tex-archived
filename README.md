**Markdown** allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

**LaTeX*	* is a document preparation system and document markup language.

Markdown is exponentially easier to learn than LaTeX because of its simplicity. Basics of Markdown can be learnt within minutes. LaTeX is vast and complex. However, basics of complex LaTeX programming can be toned down and substituted with Markdown codes.

md2tex allows creating LaTeX documents using markdown.
